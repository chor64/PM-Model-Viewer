# PM-Model-Viewer
A tool for viewing Super Paper Mario model files.

A way to export the models, and map support is planned, but no promises.<br>
Made in unity engine, I initially tried to make it on winforms C# but gave up.

Probably only works on Windows, because of the libraries; Not tested on any other platform.

Uses [marco-calautti's Rainbow.ImgLib](https://github.com/marco-calautti/Rainbow) for reading TPL textures,<br>
[psydack's uimgui package](https://github.com/psydack/uimgui) for the UI,<br>
and [Ookii.Dialogs](http://www.ookii.org/software/dialogs/) for the Open File Dialogs.
